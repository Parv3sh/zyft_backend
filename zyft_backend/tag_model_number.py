# def tag_html(HTML):
# pass
# You need to write a class that can be initialised with list of model numbers (approximately 1 million).
# Write an efficient function that can tag HTML really quickly.
# Itâ€™s okay to take longer while preprocessing in __init__ , but tag_html functions need to be really efficient.
# Guidelines:
# 1. __init__ can take a long time even hours
# 2. tag_html should finish tagging a HTML in less than a second.

# Output of the function should be start and end indexes of the model number in html and
# # Outut and sample execution

# Explanation:
# We use a trie to store all the model numbers. Then we iterate through the html string and check if the current character is in the trie. If it is, we keep going until we find a model number or we reach the end of the html string. If we find a model number, we add it to the result.

# Note: This solution assumes that the model numbers are not substrings of each other. If they are, we would need to add a check to make sure that the model number is not a substring of another model number.
